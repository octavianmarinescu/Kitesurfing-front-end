## How it works

The application is connected to an existent backend through an API.
First I get a token that will allow the access to the rest of the endpoints.
After this I can access all the endpoints that will give me the rest of the info.
All the details from the backend will be displayed in a table.
When an user will click on a row from the table, a popup with details will appear.
The user can Add to favorites any location and this will be displayed with yellow color.

Also, there is a country filter button that will display all the locations available in that country for kitesurfing.
